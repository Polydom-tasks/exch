The project should be launched with one command after cloning the repository, preferably via "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d".
PostgreSQL must also run in a container.

4. Applying Migrations with Predefined Data:
Include a migration script that initializes the database with predefined currency data, including names, codes, and initial exchange rates.
Ensure that these migrations are automatically applied when setting up the project, either during the initial setup or during container initialization.
Document the migration process and provide instructions for running migrations when setting up the project.

Notes:
Once development is complete, provide instructions for installing and running the project, as well as examples of using the API.
Set up a CI script that will do the following:
Check the syntax of your code for errors (for example, using pylint or flake8 for Python).
Run automated tests for your application (if any).
Generate a report on code coverage by tests (if possible).
